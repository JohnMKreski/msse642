# Identification and Authentication Failures

## Introduction & Description

Identification and Authentication Failures (formerly "Broken Authentication") refer to weaknesses in how systems confirm user identities and protect credentials. These flaws allow attackers to compromise passwords, session tokens, or user identities — potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive systems.

Common causes include:

- Weak or guessable passwords
- Insecure credential storage (e.g., plaintext or weak hashing)
- Missing account lockouts or rate-limiting
- Session fixation or improper session handling
- Flawed MFA implementations

**Example:**  
A web application allows unlimited login attempts without throttling or CAPTCHA. An attacker uses credential stuffing to automate login attempts and compromise thousands of user accounts using breached credentials.

## Specific Real-World Example: Twitter Bitcoin Scam (2020)

In July 2020, Twitter experienced a major breach where attackers gained access to internal admin tools, allowing them to take over high-profile accounts (Elon Musk, Barack Obama, Apple, etc.) and promote a cryptocurrency scam.

While social engineering was involved, the core issue was **weak internal authentication controls**. Attackers targeted Twitter employees with access to internal systems, then leveraged poor internal MFA enforcement and monitoring gaps to escalate privileges and bypass identification safeguards.

The result: 130+ accounts were compromised, including those of major public figures and companies. The event demonstrated how critical strong identity verification is — not just for end users, but for privileged internal systems.

## Analysis About How to Prevent

To prevent identification and authentication failures:

- Enforce **strong password policies** and multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all accounts — especially admins.
- Use **rate-limiting and account lockouts** on login endpoints.
- Store credentials securely using salted hash algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).
- Invalidate sessions after logout or after periods of inactivity.
- Implement **monitoring and alerts** for unusual login activity (e.g., location anomalies or login spikes).
- Avoid insecure "remember me" or token reuse mechanisms.

## My Thoughts

This topic reinforced how identity is the first line of defense. It’s easy to focus on end-user login screens, but the Twitter case showed how **internal authentication systems** are just as vulnerable — and often more damaging when breached. As a student, it’s a reminder that authentication best practices must be enforced everywhere, not just on the frontend.

## Conclusion / Closing

Identification and authentication failures remain a top target for attackers. Weak login protections, poorly stored credentials, and unmonitored admin access can all lead to major breaches. Strong authentication requires consistent policies, secure storage, and vigilant monitoring across all system layers.
