# Assignment 5 Collab File

### Assignment Description

This collaborative assignment demonstrates our ability to use GitHub for real-world team development. Instead of each person working on a separate fork, we used a shared repository with collaborators added directly. Each student created a personal branch, added their section to this Markdown file, and then pushed their changes. A pull request was created for each branch to merge changes into the main branch. GitHub's history will reflect each contributor's work and commits.

#### Underneath your name, write an introduction to yourself along with the date.

I am excited about the development role My journey from a bachelorâ€™s in chemistry to a Junior Developer at Tata, and now a Masterâ€™s in the U.S., has equipped me with valuable analytical and technical skills. Transitioning from chemistry to software development was a significant shift, driven by my passion for technologyâ€™s problem-solving capabilities.
